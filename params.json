That growth should be relied upon for later challenges. A natural progression from challenge to challenge should be evident.\r\n\r\n#### Reusable\r\nEach challenge should be tunable such that unique variants can be generated with minimal effort.\r\n\r\n### Sponsored by\r\n![NSF](https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/83610990/nsf1.jpg =40*40)\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nFor more information, please contact @nsslab-yin or send email to yin@cs.uga.edu, weâ€™ll help you sort it out.\r\n",
