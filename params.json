  "body": "### Welcome to SR-CTF\r\nThe project `SR-CTF` is being sponsored by the `NSF` with the goal of enhancing and broadening computer security education through the development of `Stepwise` and `Reusable` CTF challenges that emphasize problem solving.\r\n\r\n#### Stepwise\r\nA user's skillset should grow as they progress from one challenge to the next. That growth should be relied upon for later challenges. A natural progression from challenge to challenge should be evident.\r\n\r\n#### Reusable\r\nEach challenge should be tunable such that unique variants can be generated with minimal effort.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### Get Started\r\nThe project consists of two main part: \r\n* A website framework to be installed on server, the website is used to hold all challenge contents.\r\n* Challenge sequences with different security topics\r\n\r\n#### Set up Website Framework\r\n* First get this [repository](https://github.com/nsslab-yin/SRCTF), follow the instructions to set up your server\r\n\r\n#### Imported Challenge Sequences\r\n* Follow the instructions and import challenge contents into the server, then you are all set!\r\n* We provided some interesting challenge sequences here:\r\n    [Available challenge sequences](https://nsslab-yin.github.io/challenge.html)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nIf you have any questions or need more information, please contact @nsslab-yin or send email to yin@cs.uga.edu, weâ€™ll help you sort it out.\r\n* This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Award No. 1318881.\r\n",
